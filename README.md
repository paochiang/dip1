Depth Image Processing
======================

Depth Image Processing (DIP) is a library of research code created by
[Greg Meyer](http://gregmeyer.info/) at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign. The following projects are currently implemented in DIP:

* [Real-time 3D face modeling with a commodity depth camera]
(http://gregmeyer.info/papers/icme2013.pdf)
* [Improving Face Detection with Depth]
(http://gregmeyer.info/papers/icassp2016.pdf)

DIP can be compiled and installed using CMake.

### Requirements ###

* CUDA 5.0
* Eigen 3.0.0
* HDF5
* OpenCV
* OpenNI2
* OpenGL/GLUT
