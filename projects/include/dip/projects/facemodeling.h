// This project generates a 3D face model by registering and integrating a
// sequence of segmented depth images captured by a PrimeSense depth sensor. To
// construct a model the system performs the following steps:
//    1. Segmentation    - The user's head is segmented by from the depth image.
//                         We assume the user is positioned in front of a fixed
//                         depth camera with their head and shoulders clearly
//                         visible.
//    2. Filtering       - To reduce noise and improve registration, the depth
//                         image is filtered. A bilateral filter is used to
//                         remove noise while preserving depth discontinuities.
//    3. Back-Projection - To register the depth data, we need to create a
//                         point-cloud by back-projection the depth pixels to
//                         3D vertices.
//    5. Registration    - Iterative closest point (ICP) is used to determine
//                         the rigid body transformation that aligns the
//                         point-clouds. In order to maintain a real-time rate,
//                         a fast variant of ICP is used. This method assumes
//                         small angles of rotation between depth frames. In
//                         addition, the point-clouds are pre-aligned based on
//                         their center of mass.
//    6. Integration     - Once the rigid body transformation is known, the
//                         depth images can be integrated into volumetric model.
//                         The volume contains millions of voxels, where each
//                         voxel contains a signed distance to the nearest
//                         surface computed along camera rays.
//    7. Rendering       - Ray casting is used to render the current state of
//                         the model. For each pixel, a corresponding ray is
//                         stepped through the volume. A surface is found when
//                         the ray steps from a positive signed distance to a
//                         negative signed distance.
// After constructing the volumetric model, a mesh is generated using marching
// cubes.

// are averaged together to reduce noise in the reconstructed surface. The max
// truncation should be roughly the maximum amount of noise that could be added
